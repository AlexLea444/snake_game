# Snake Game

by Alex Lea
May 14, 2024

This is a simple recreation of the classic game "Snake".
The game is also an effective way to practice vim motions, as the snake
can be controlled by H/J/K/L as well as the arrow keys or WASD.

The purpose of this project was to gain experience with HTML/CSS/JS, and
to apply OOP knowledge primarily gained in C++ and Rust to JavaScript.
